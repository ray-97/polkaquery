    "description": "The suspended inbound XCMP channels. All others are not suspended.   This is a `StorageValue` instead of a `StorageMap` since we expect multiple reads per block  to different keys with a one byte payload. The access to `BoundedBTreeSet` will be cached  within the block and therefore only included once in the proof size.   NOTE: The PoV benchmarking cannot know this and will over-estimate, but the actual proof  will be smaller.",
