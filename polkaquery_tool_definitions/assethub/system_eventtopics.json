    "description": "Mapping between a topic (represented by T::Hash) and a vector of indexes  of events in the `<Events<T>>` list.   All topic vectors have deterministic storage locations depending on the topic. This  allows light-clients to leverage the changes trie storage tracking mechanism and  in case of changes fetch the list of events of interest.   The value has the type `(BlockNumberFor<T>, EventIndex)` because if we used only just  the `EventIndex` then in case if the topic has the same contents on the next block  no notification will be triggered thus the event might be lost.",
