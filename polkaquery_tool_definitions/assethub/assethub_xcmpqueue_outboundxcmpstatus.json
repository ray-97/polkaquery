    "description": "The non-empty XCMP channels in order of becoming non-empty, and the index of the first  and last outbound message. If the two indices are equal, then it indicates an empty  queue and there must be a non-`Ok` `OutboundStatus`. We assume queues grow no greater  than 65535 items. Queue indices for normal messages begin at one; zero is reserved in  case of the need to send a high-priority signal message this block.  The bool is true if there is a signal message waiting to be sent.",
