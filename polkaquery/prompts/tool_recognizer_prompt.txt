Instructions:
1. Analyze the User Query.
2. Your only goal is to match the query to the single most appropriate tool from the provided list of Subscan API tools.
3. Extract all necessary parameters for the chosen tool as defined in its Parameters Schema.
4. If required parameters are missing and have no default, you must not select the tool. Instead, respond with intent `unknown` and a reason.
5. Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object in the format: {{"intent": "chosen_tool_name", "parameters": {{"param_name": "value"}}}}.
